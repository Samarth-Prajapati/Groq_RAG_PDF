# 📄 PDF-based Q&A RAG Application

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based Question–Answering application that allows users to upload a PDF and ask questions strictly grounded in the document content. The app is built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **FAISS**, **HuggingFace embeddings**, and **Groq-hosted LLMs**.

## 🚀 Features

* Upload any **PDF document**
* Automatic **text extraction and chunking**
* **Vector database creation** using FAISS
* Semantic search using **HuggingFace sentence embeddings**
* Context-aware answers generated by **Groq LLaMA model**
* Prevents hallucination by answering **only from document context**
* Simple and interactive **Streamlit UI**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Streamlit** – Web UI
* **LangChain** – RAG orchestration
* **Groq (LLaMA 3.1)** – Large Language Model
* **HuggingFace Sentence Transformers** – Embeddings
* **FAISS** – Vector similarity search
* **python-dotenv** – Environment variable management

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── app.py              # Main Streamlit application
├── .env                # Environment variables (not committed)
├── requirements.txt    # Project dependencies
├── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🔐 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

---

## 📦 Installation (Using Conda – Recommended)

```bash
conda create -n genai python=3.11 -y
conda activate genai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads a PDF file
2. PDF is temporarily saved on the system
3. Text is extracted using `PyPDFLoader`
4. Text is split into overlapping chunks
5. Embeddings are generated using HuggingFace model
6. FAISS stores vectors for fast retrieval
7. User question retrieves relevant chunks
8. Groq-hosted LLaMA model generates answer

The model is **strictly instructed not to hallucinate** if the answer is not present in the document.

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

* Academic document Q&A
* Research paper analysis
* Company policy assistant
* Legal or technical document search
* Interview or study preparation

---

## 📊 Performance Notes

* Initial PDF processing may take time depending on size
* Smaller PDFs respond faster
* Embeddings are created only once per session

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Multi-PDF upload support
* Source citations in answers
* Persistent vector database
* Streaming responses
* Authentication and user sessions
